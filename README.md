# Build AI Agents with Azure Database for PostgreSQL and Azure AI Agent Service

Combine Azure Database for PostgreSQL with Azure AI Agent Service to create intelligent AI agents.

AI agents are revolutionizing how applications interact with data by combining large language models (LLMs) with external tools and databases. This blog will show you how to combine Azure Database for PostgreSQL with Azure AI Agent Service to create intelligent AI agents that can search and analyze your data. We'll use a legal research assistant as our example, walk through setup, implementation, and testing. With just a few hours of work, you can build an AI solution that would have taken weeks of traditional development.

## Features Showcased in the Sample Repo

* Vector Search on Azure Database for PostgreSQL
* Using Postgres tool for Azure AI Agent Service
* Testing with Azure AI Foundry Playground
* Debugging with Azure AI Foundry Tracing
